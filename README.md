# SmartSplitPDF

> **Split your PDF into Color and Black & White streams — automatically.**  
> Save up to 80% on printing costs by sending only the pages that need color to a color printer.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Color Detection** — Inspects every page's drawing commands (RGB, CMYK, image pixels) to classify it as color or black & white.
- **Ignore a Color** — Pick specific colors (e.g., a logo tint) that should not trigger the "color" classification. Useful when a brand color appears on every page but you still want to print those pages in B&W.
- **Exclude a Region** — Draw a rectangle over any area (header, logo, watermark) on the PDF preview; that region is skipped during color detection.
- **Back to Back (BtoB) Printing** — Keeps front and back pages together for double-sided printing. If either side of a sheet contains color, both pages are routed to the color stream.
- **Original Page Numbers Preserved** — Each output page is stamped with its original page number so you can match printed pages back to the source document.
- **Temporary Server Processing** — Files are uploaded to the Node server for processing, the source upload is deleted after analysis, and generated downloads expire automatically.
- **4-Step Wizard UI** — Clean, guided workflow: Upload → Configure → Preview & Process → Download.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or later
- **npm** v9 or later

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranavsupugade1489-stack/SmartSplitPDF.git
cd SmartSplitPDF
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

For production, run the app behind a host or reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS. Set `FORCE_HTTPS=true` only when the proxy forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto`.

### Low-cost 1 GB server settings

For a small DigitalOcean Droplet or similar 1 GB VPS, start with the conservative settings in `.env.droplet-1gb.example`:

```bash
MAX_UPLOAD_MB=15
MAX_PDF_PAGES=80
MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=1
RESULT_TTL_MS=300000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=10
```

These settings keep only one PDF job active at a time, reject very large documents early, and remove generated files after 5 minutes. If the server stays stable, raise `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` or `MAX_PDF_PAGES` gradually.

For debug mode (Node.js inspector):

```bash
npm run debug
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Color Detection

Each PDF page is inspected using **two complementary checks**:

1. **PDF Color Operators**  
   PDF.js reads each page's drawing instructions. If any `setFillRGBColor`, `setStrokeRGBColor`, `setFillCMYKColor`, or similar operator sets a color whose channels differ enough to indicate visible hue, the page is marked as color.

2. **Embedded Image Pixels**  
   For pages containing images, the pixel data is sampled. If any pixel has a meaningful difference between its R, G, and B channels (threshold > 8), the image — and thus the page — is considered color.

A **Euclidean distance threshold** (radius = 40 in RGB space) is used for the "ignore color" feature, so minor color variations around the picked color are also suppressed.

### Page Splitting

After classification, `pdf-lib` copies each page into one of two new PDF documents:

- `<filename>-color.pdf` — pages with detected color
- `<filename>-black-white.pdf` — pages without detected color

Each copied page receives a stamped original page number at the bottom center.

## 🎨 UI Walkthrough

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| **1 — Upload** | Drag & drop or browse to select a PDF (max 100 MB). |
| **2 — Configure** | Optionally pick colors to ignore (eyedropper), draw an exclusion region, or enable Back to Back (BtoB) printing. |
| **3 — Preview & Process** | The server analyzes the document. A thumbnail grid shows original, color, and B&W pages. |
| **4 — Download** | Download the Color PDF and/or the Black & White PDF separately. |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Edge Cases

- PDFs using **non-standard or device-specific color spaces** may not be classified correctly.
- Pages with **tiny colored marks** (e.g., a single colored pixel) will still be classified as color.
- Scanned B&W pages **saved as slightly tinted color images** may be detected as color due to scanner noise.
- JPEG compression artifacts can introduce subtle color differences that exceed the grayscale threshold.
